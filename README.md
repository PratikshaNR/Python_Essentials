Quick Overview of Each Topic
# Matplotlib
Create plots like line, bar, scatter, histogram, and pie charts.

Customize charts with titles, labels, and legends.

# OOPs
Learn about classes and objects.

Understand core principles: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction.

# Pandas
Work with Series and DataFrame for efficient data handling.

Perform filtering, grouping, merging, and cleaning data.

# Regular Expressions
Use regex to find, match, and replace patterns in text.

Practice common regex operations like search(), match(), and sub().

# Requirements
You need Python installed with the following packages:


pip install pandas matplotlib notebook
